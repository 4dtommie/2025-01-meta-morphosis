      <div class="topic-content">
        <p>Meta announced it would terminate its third-party fact-checking program in the U.S., replacing it with a "Community Notes" system similar to that used by X (formerly Twitter). This move has raised concerns about the potential spread of misinformation on its platforms. </p>

        <div class="topic-content">
          <p>Imagine your favorite grocery store. It used to remove anyone harassing others, keeping it safe and pleasant. One day, they fire the security guard and tell shoppers to handle problems themselves by leaving notes on a board.</p>

            <p>You love the store‚Äîit has great products, and your friends shop there. But things get worse. Harassment increases, and one day, someone gets hurt.</p>
            
            <p>What do you do? Switch to a less convenient store? Keep shopping because your friends are there? What if the same company owns another store you use‚Äîdo you keep supporting them?</p>
            
            <p>At what point would you say, ‚ÄúEnough is enough‚Äù?</p>

            <p>Even if you don‚Äôt pay with money, you pay with your time, attention, and data. When a company stops protecting its users, how long can you justify staying?</p>

          <p>An internal Facebook study leaked to The Wall Street Journal revealed that Instagram negatively impacts teenage mental health, especially among girls.

        <h2 class="topic-header">Cambridge Analytica Data Scandal (2019)</h2>
        <div class="topic-content">
            <div class="story">
                <p>In 2018, a major scandal exposed how Facebook (now Meta) allowed a political consulting firm, Cambridge Analytica, to harvest the personal data of 87 million users‚Äîwithout their explicit consent. This data was weaponized to influence elections, including the 2016 U.S. presidential race and the Brexit referendum.</p>
                
                <p>Here‚Äôs how it worked: a seemingly harmless personality quiz app collected data not only from those who took the quiz but also from their Facebook friends. Cambridge Analytica then used this treasure trove of information to create detailed psychological profiles, targeting people with tailored political ads designed to sway their opinions and behaviors.</p>

                <h2>The Fallout</h2>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Erosion of Trust:</strong> People began questioning Facebook‚Äôs commitment to privacy.</li>
                  <li><strong>Fines and Scrutiny:</strong> Facebook faced a record $5 billion fine from the FTC and global backlash.</li>
                  <li><strong>Broader Implications:</strong> It highlighted how easily personal data could be exploited, raising alarms about digital surveillance and the ethics of big tech.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The Cambridge Analytica scandal wasn‚Äôt just about one bad actor‚Äîit was a wake-up call. It revealed how companies like Facebook profit from our data while failing to protect it, leaving us vulnerable to manipulation.</p>

                <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
                <p>If a company uses your data for profit without regard for its consequences, can you trust them with your information? How many more scandals will it take before change happens?</p>

          <p>Facebook was criticized for allowing its platform to be used to incite violence against the Rohingya Muslim minority in Myanmar. UN investigators labeled Facebook as playing a "determining role" in the genocide, with hate speech and misinformation spreading unchecked.</p>

        <div class="topic-content">
        <p>Despite assurances of end-to-end encryption, WhatsApp's recent moves towards data collection and integration with other Meta platforms raise concerns about user privacy in the US. The lack of a backdoor for law enforcement access in WhatsApp, unlike some competitors, has also sparked debate.</p>
        <p>Example: Meta's recent announcement of a new data-sharing policy between WhatsApp and Facebook has caused alarm among privacy advocates, who fear increased user surveillance.</p>
