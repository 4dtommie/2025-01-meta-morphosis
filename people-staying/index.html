  <ul class="topic-list">
    <li>
      <h2 class="topic-header">Everyone's on it, so I have to be.</h2>
      <div class="topic-content">
          <p>It's true that Meta products have a large user base, but that doesn't mean you have to be a part of it. There are plenty of other ways to stay connected with friends and family, and you might even find that you prefer some of the alternatives. Plus, being a part of the majority isn't always the best choice. Sometimes it's good to think for yourself and make your own decisions, even if they're different from what everyone else is doing.</p>
      </div>
  </li>
  <li>
      <h2 class="topic-header">I'll lose touch with people if I leave.</h2>
      <div class="topic-content">
          <p>Staying in touch is about making an effort, not just being on the same social media platform. You can still call, text, email, or meet up in person with the people you care about. And if someone only stays in touch with you through Meta, are they really making an effort to connect with you?</p>
      </div>
  </li>
  <li>
      <h2 class="topic-header">It's the only way to keep up with events and news.</h2>
      <div class="topic-content">
          <p>Meta can be a source of information, but it's not the only one. You can get your news from reputable news organizations, and many local events are advertised through other channels like community websites, email newsletters, and local papers. Relying solely on Meta can actually limit your perspective and expose you to misinformation.</p>
      </div>
  </li>
  <li>
      <h2 class="topic-header">I use it for work/business, so I can't quit.</h2>
      <div class="topic-content">
          <p>While Meta products can be useful for business, they shouldn't be the sole platform you rely on. Having your own website, email list, and presence on other platforms can actually make your business more resilient and less dependent on a single company's policies.</p>
      </div>
  </li>
  <li>
      <h2 class="topic-header">I'm already used to it, it's too much effort to switch.</h2>
      <div class="topic-content">
          <p>Switching to new platforms might take a little time to adjust, but it's not as hard as you think. Many alternative platforms have similar features and interfaces, and you might even find some that you like better. Plus, the benefits of leaving Meta, like increased privacy and reduced exposure to harmful content, can be worth the initial effort.</p>
      </div>
  </li>
  <li>
      <h2 class="topic-header">I don't want to miss out on anything.</h2>
      <div class="topic-content">
          <p>The fear of missing out (FOMO) is a powerful feeling, but it's important to remember that social media often presents a curated and unrealistic view of other people's lives. You're not really missing out on anything by not seeing every post and update. Instead, you can focus on your own life and experiences, and connect with people in more meaningful ways.</p>
      </div>
  </li>
  <li>
      <h2 class="topic-header">It's free, so why not use it?</h2>
      <div class="topic-content">
          <p>Meta products might be free in terms of monetary cost, but you're paying with your data and attention. Your data is valuable to Meta, and they use it to target you with ads. Additionally, spending too much time on these platforms can have negative effects on your mental health and well-being.</p>
      </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h2 class="topic-header">The alternatives suck and/or are pretty bad companies as well</h2>
    <div class="topic-content">
        <p>Open source alternatives often don't have the resources of a big corporate, but they've come a long way.</p>
        <p>It might be true that other options are not good either, or will turn bad, but at one point instagram was fine as well before it got bought by Meta.</p>
    </div>
</li>
  <li>
      <h2 class="topic-header">I've invested so much time and effort into my profile.</h2>
      <div class="topic-content">
          <p>It can be hard to leave something you've put time into, but it's important to remember that your worth is not defined by your social media presence. You can always create new profiles on other platforms, and you might even find that you prefer a fresh start.</p>
      </div>
  </li>
  <li>
      <h2 class="topic-header">I don't know enough about the alternatives.</h2>
      <div class="topic-content">
          <p>There are many alternative social media platforms and communication tools available, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. Doing a little research can help you find options that better suit your needs and values.</p>

  <li>
      <h2 class="topic-header">It's just how things are now, I can't change anything.</h2>
      <div class="topic-content">
          <p>While it might seem like Meta's dominance is inevitable, individual choices can make a difference. By choosing to leave Meta products, you're sending a message that you value your privacy and autonomy. You're also supporting the development of alternative platforms and a more diverse social media landscape.</p>
