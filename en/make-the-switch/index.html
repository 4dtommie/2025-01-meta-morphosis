                <div class="topic-content">
                    <p>Research and explore alternative social media platforms, messaging apps, and communication tools. Consider what you valued most about Meta products and look for platforms that offer similar or better features. There are options focused on privacy, specific interests, or different forms of interaction. Don't feel pressured to replace everything at once; start with what's most important to you.</p>

                <div class="topic-content">
                    <p>Before fully committing to leaving Meta, create accounts on your chosen alternatives and experiment with them. Get familiar with the interface, features, and community. This trial period allows you to assess whether the platform meets your needs and preferences, and allows you to transfer valuable information before deleting your old account.</p>

            <li>
                <h3 class="topic-header"><span class="chevron">▸</span> Experiment with friends & family</h3>
                <div class="topic-content">
                    <p>Invite a few close friends or family members to join you on the new platforms. This creates a small, familiar community to start with and makes the transition smoother. Sharing experiences and feedback can help everyone adjust and discover the benefits of the new platform together.</p>

                <div class="topic-content">
                    <p>Most Meta platforms offer the option to download an archive of your data, including posts, photos, messages, and other information. This is a good way to preserve memories and important content before deleting your account. Be aware that this download can be quite large, so ensure you have sufficient storage space.</p>

                <h3 class="topic-header"><span class="chevron">▸</span> Gradually reduce your usage</h3>
                <div class="topic-content">
                    <p>Instead of abruptly deleting your accounts, consider gradually reducing your usage. This can help you break the habit of checking Meta platforms and make the transition less jarring. You can start by limiting your time spent on the platforms each day or unfollowing/muting accounts that contribute to negative feelings.</p>

                <div class="topic-content">
                    <p>Before deleting your accounts, give your friends and family a heads-up. Share your alternative contact information (phone number, email, other social platforms) so they know how to reach you. This helps maintain connections and prevents misunderstandings. You can make a final post announcing your departure, or reach out to close contacts individually.</p>
